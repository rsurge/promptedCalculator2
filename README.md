## 🛠️ How It Was Built

### Step 1: HTML Structure (`index.html`)
- Created a semantic HTML5 structure with proper meta tags
- Set up a calculator container with display and button sections
- Used data attributes for easy JavaScript targeting
- Included proper accessibility features

**Key Elements:**
- Display area with previous and current operand sections
- Grid-based button layout with clear class names
- Data attributes for JavaScript event handling

### Step 2: Modern CSS Styling (`styles.css`)
- Implemented glassmorphism design with backdrop-filter blur effects
- Created a beautiful gradient background
- Used CSS Grid for responsive button layout
- Added smooth transitions and hover animations
- Implemented mobile-responsive design with media queries

**Design Features:**
- Glass-like calculator interface with transparency
- Color-coded buttons (orange operators, red clear, green equals)
- Smooth hover and click animations
- Responsive design that adapts to screen size

### Step 3: JavaScript Functionality (`script.js`)
- Built a Calculator class with object-oriented programming
- Implemented all basic mathematical operations
- Added keyboard support for enhanced user experience
- Included proper error handling and edge case management

**Core Functions:**
- `appendNumber()`: Adds digits to current operand
- `chooseOperation()`: Handles mathematical operations
- `compute()`: Performs calculations
- `clear()`: Resets calculator state
- `delete()`: Removes last digit
- `updateDisplay()`: Updates the visual display

## 🎮 How to Use

### Mouse/Touch Controls:
- Click number buttons (0-9) to input numbers
- Click operation buttons (+, -, ×, ÷, %) to perform calculations
- Click equals (=) to see the result
- Click AC to clear everything
- Click ⌫ to delete the last digit

### Keyboard Controls:
- **Numbers**: `0-9` keys
- **Decimal**: `.` key
- **Operations**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **Equals**: `Enter` or `=` key
- **Clear**: `Escape` key
- **Delete**: `Backspace` key

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Glassmorphism Design:
- Semi-transparent backgrounds with blur effects
- Subtle borders and shadows
- Modern, clean aesthetic
- Excellent visual hierarchy

### Color Scheme:
- **Background**: Purple gradient (#667eea to #764ba2)
- **Calculator**: Semi-transparent white with blur
- **Display**: Dark background for contrast
- **Buttons**: Color-coded by function

### Responsive Design:
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexible grid system
- Adaptive button sizes
- Touch-friendly interface
